Snake AI using DQN to Solve the Game
This repository contains a Snake AI Python application that employs the Deep Q-Network (DQN) algorithm to solve the classic Snake game. The application is designed using the tkinter library for the graphical user interface and utilizes reinforcement learning techniques to train an AI agent to play the game effectively.

Overview
The primary goal of this project is to demonstrate how the DQN algorithm can be applied to create an AI agent that learns to play the Snake game. The project provides a comprehensive example of combining game development, machine learning, and graphical visualization.

Environment Setup
To replicate this project on your local machine, follow these steps:

Create a Conda environment with Python 3.7:

lua
Copy code
conda create -n snake-ai python=3.7
Activate the Conda environment:

Copy code
conda activate snake-ai
Install required dependencies:

Copy code
pip install torch torchvision matplotlib ipython pygame
Running the Application
Clone the repository from GitHub:

bash
