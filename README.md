Snake AI using DQN to Solve the Game
This repository contains a Snake AI Python application that employs the Deep Q-Network (DQN) algorithm to solve the classic Snake game. The application is designed using the tkinter library for the graphical user interface and utilizes reinforcement learning techniques to train an AI agent to play the game effectively.

Overview
The primary goal of this project is to demonstrate how the DQN algorithm can be applied to create an AI agent that learns to play the Snake game. The project provides a comprehensive example of combining game development, machine learning, and graphical visualization.
